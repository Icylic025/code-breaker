## Code Breaker (Caesar Cipher Decryption)

This program decrypts messages encrypted using a [Caesar cipher technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher). The encrypted message is read from a file named cypher.txt. The program generates 25 possible plaintext translations, ranks them based on English letter frequency analysis, and displays the top 3 translations in descending order of likelihood on the console.
